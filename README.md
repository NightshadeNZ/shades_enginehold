A basic engine hold script for FiveM

This is my very first time creating a script so it is probably not perfect, but it works! I am not too familiar with general scripting as I mainly focus on the vehicle dev'ing but I thought I would give it a go.
Press F to exit vehicle but engine turns off as normal,
Hold F to exit vehicle, keeps engine running (mainly for the use of emergency vehicle lighting)
